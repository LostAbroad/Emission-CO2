# CO2-Emissions-Map

This map is meant to be used as a reference for helping individuals visualize and understand the different factors that go into the role of
CO2. There are different variations to play with: GDP, Population Growth, as well as Population Density. Unfortunately, due to two different changes in group dynamics (many at the last minute) and realisitically only two individuals working on the project some functionality features
such as a graph or legend have been left out of the final project (at least from a viewing perspective). The makings of a graph and legend are
still present in the code, it just hasn't been completely implemented at this time. Should you wish to continue the project and go further
please feel free to do so.
